# Laser-Harp-code-for-the-University-of-Edinburgh-08.2025
This is the complete code for the laser harp project as of August 2025â€”it only includes the Arduino part. For the Raspberry Pi part, please visit the following link.

I hope this will be helpful for those who want to make their own laser harp or plan to continue this project.

Important notes: In "Laser Harp 2025/Analog joystick slide and distance sensor vibrato" and "Laser Harp 2025/Analog joystick slide and switch vibrato". I tried replacing the original separate definitions of sensors with arrays. However, the original versions were not deleted, which may cause some potential errors that have not yet been found.
